			<h2>Project Description:</h2>
				<p>This project simulated a 12-question quiz based on countries and their geographic and cultural significance. The goal of this project was to show off my skills in using loops, functions, and dictionaries in Python3.</p>

			<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
				<p>I used the Python programming language to build the application.</p>

			<h3>Features Implemented:</h3>
				<p>This project is a multiple choice quiz with 12 questions. Each question and its options, A/B/C/D, are displayed to the user. The user must input their answer choice and if their answer is correct, they will be congratulated and their score will go up by 1. If they are incorrect, they will be told they are wrong and move on to the next question. At the end of the quiz, the program will display the total score to the user.</p>

			<h3>Challenges Faced:</h3>
				<p>Though I had an easier time with this project than the previous ones, I still struggled with indexing dictionaries and using them in for loops. I also struggled with making use of the .upper() method.</p>

      <h3>Learning and Achievements:</h3>
        <p>Through this project I was able to become more comfortable with using for loops and functions in more situations, such as utilizing functions inside a for loop, alongside dictionary indexes.</p>

      <h3>Future Enhancements:</h3>
        <p>In the future I hope to implement a way to give users a second chance on questions if they get it wrong and to randomize the order of the questions and options. I also want to have more question options to choose from and then randomize what questions will be given to the user.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>This project was a way for me to test how comfortable I am with using dictionaries, for loops, and functions.</p>
